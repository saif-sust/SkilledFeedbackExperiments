<h2>Invitation to Participate:</h2>
<p> We invite you to participate in this study about how people give advice to AI agents.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the Study:</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how the level of skill of a human and the type of game being played
affect the human's ability to give feedback to an agent.</p>

<h2>Participation:</h2>
<p>If you wish to participate in this study, you will start by filling out a short survey.
You will then be asked to play 3 rounds (note that 1 round may consist of multiple lives) of a game.
We ask that you please play the game to the best of your ability and get as far as possible.
Following that, you will watch as an AI plays the game for 3 rounds. You will be asked to give simple
feedback to the agent in realtime as it plays the game.
The final step of the study is to complete a short questionnaire.
The study should take about 30 minutes to complete, but the exact amount of time will vary depending
on how the games playout.
You do not have to answer any questions that you are not comfortable with, and you may stop at any
point by simply closing the window and none of your data will be used in the research.</p>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<p>So long as the tasks are completed as requested by the instructions, you will recieve
payment for your participation in this study. When playing the game, <strong>you will receive a bonus
the better you perform in the game.</strong></p>

<h2>Risks:</h2>
<p> This study involves minimal risk which includes minor fatigue due to the concentration required to finish the task. There is 
also the normal risk of interacting with a computer (e.g. eye strain). 
You can withdraw from the study at any point until submitting the response.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Anonymity:</h2>
<p> All results from the study will remain confidential. We will only use results from the study for the purposes of this research. 
The only people who will have access to the research data are the Principal Investigators and researchers working on this study.
Results will be published in pooled (aggregate) format. Your data will be anonymous as you will not provide your name or any 
personal information.</p>

<h2>Data Storage:</h2>
<p> The results will come from the surveys, gameplay data, and AI agent interaction data. This data will be 
stored in AWS S3 within their Canadian data centers. Only researchers on this project will get access to this data.</p>
