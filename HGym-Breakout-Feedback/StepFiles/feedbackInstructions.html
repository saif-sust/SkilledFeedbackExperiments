    <p> Now that you have finished playing the game, you will give live feedback to an AI
        that is playing the same game. This will again happen over 3 playthroughs of the game.
        Throughout the course of the game, there will be three feedback buttons you can press
        at anyime: positive, negative, and neutral. The buttons can be clicked any number of times
        at any time during the game to let the AI know how it is doing. Note that there may be
        no visual changes when you click a feedback button, but the data will be logged.
        Please click the buttons to give feedback at least several times every minutes.
